# aks
Code and instructions to use AKS (free tier)

# Starters
In the docs dir, you will find a few readmes that will give you a few initial steps to get started.





# Cost
In the cost-analysis dir, there's some rudimentary cost-analysis of a simple AKS cluster, running for 3 days. I wouldn't advise extrapolating any cost data out of it as I was bound by the $200 credit limitations. But I think that the Azure charts and cost data is neat.
